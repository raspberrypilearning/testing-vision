# What's next?
Now that you've got a tool to use your image classification models with, you can move on to creating your own model in [Cats vs. Dogs](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/retraining-model). Where you will take an existing model trained to recognise lots of different kinds of images and retrain it to determine whether images show dogs or cats.
