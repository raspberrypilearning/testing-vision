## Introduction

Add project description here. What will learners be making?

### What you will make
You will create a Python function for testing a computer's recognition of an object by supplying a photograph of that object and getting back the computer's guess at what it is. This will be a useful tool for you in future projects, to test the models you create and to get the results of others' models when using them as part of an application.
